# Music Recommendation System README

## Project Overview

The Music Recommendation System is a web application designed to classify music tracks into different genres, identify their emotions, and recommend songs to users based on their personal preferences and listening history. This document provides an overview of the system's functionality, technology stack, and instructions for running it.

## Analysed Chronology

### 1. Music Classification

Our system utilizes machine learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to analyze music tracks and categorize them into various genres. This allows users to explore and discover music within their preferred genres.

### 2. Emotion Analysis

In addition to genre classification, the system can also analyze the emotional content of music. It uses sentiment analysis and emotion recognition models to assess the emotional qualities of the music, such as happy, sad, energetic, or calm.

### 3. User Recommendations

The system takes into account each user's listening history and preferences to provide personalized music recommendations. By analyzing past listening habits, it suggests new music that aligns with the user's taste, enhancing the overall user experience.

### 4. User Interface (UI)

We have developed a user-friendly web application interface using React.js and Tailwind CSS. The UI allows users to interact with the system, input their preferences, and receive music recommendations. An intuitive and visually appealing UI is crucial for a positive user experience.

### 5. Efficiency

To meet the project's 24-hour timeframe, we leveraged pre-existing music classification and sentiment analysis models, and open-source libraries. This approach expedited development, allowing us to focus on integrating these components and creating a smooth user experience.

### 6. Working Prototype

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a working prototype of our music recommendation system with a functioning user interface. Users can input their preferences, receive genre and emotion-based music recommendations, and play the recommended tracks.

## Tech Stacks and Models

- **Frontend**: React.js and Figma for UI design
- **Backend**: Express.js and Node.js for server-side logic
- **Machine Learning Models**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for music classification
- **Language**: Python for machine learning model integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for UI design

## Interface Requirements

To ensure a seamless user experience, the system incorporates the following features:

1. **Music Player**: Users can listen to music with an integrated player. Lyrics are also available, enhancing the listening experience.

2. **Recognition and Classification**: The system can recognize and classify music into genres and emotions, enabling users to explore music based on their mood and preferences.

3. **Recommendation System**: Utilizing previous listening history and user preferences, the system suggests music that aligns with the user's taste. This personalization enhances the user's music discovery.

4. **Distinctive Element**: The system has a unique feature that makes it stand out. This can be a unique user interface design, a special recommendation algorithm, or any other innovative aspect.
